/* MonthTable: Define a table of the names of months of the year and the number of days in each month. 
** Write out that table to a std::stringstream. Do this two ways, in unit tests:
**   1. once using a std::array of std::string for the names, and another std::array for the number of days 
**   2. a second time using a std::array of structs, with each structure holding the name of a month 
**      (as a std::string) and the number of days in it.
